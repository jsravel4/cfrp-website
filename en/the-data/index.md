title: Introduction to the Database
---

We currently offer three tools to access the database.

1. <a href="http://app.cfregisters.org/registers" target="_blank">Faceted Browser</a>.
This tool allows users introductory access to the database. Here you can explore data about authors, plays, genres, and selected ticket categories by season or by day of the week. By clicking on the camera icons on the left of the screen, you can also open up register pages in a new window.

2. [Pivot Browser](/app).
This tool allows users more advanced access to the database. Here you can build more sophisticated queries which will display in tabular format. The results in turn are linked to a calendrical visualisation.

3. HTTP API.
This tool is for programmers. It offers full access to a complete copy of the compiled data in JSON format, and a live query interface, with filtering, pagination and ordering functionality. An OPTIONS request to http://api.cfregisters.org/ returns available endpoints; an OPTIONS request to any endpoint returns its structure. Further documentation on query format is available <a href="https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest/wiki/Routing">here</a>.

The database at the heart of the Com&eacute;die-Française Registers Project derives from the daily box office attendance records kept assiduously by the troupe from its founding in 1680 to the Revolution, and beyond. High resolution virtual reproductions of these records can be found here [link to flipbooks index page]. The troupe maintained detailed receipt records because the Crown insisted that the actors donate a portion of each evening’s proceeds to charities, to mollify the French Catholic critics of the stage&rsquo;s &ldquo;sinfulness.&rdquo; In addition, the members of the troupe split the remaining revenue among themselves according to seniority within the troupe. A detailed accounting was necessary to maintain harmony among the players themselves.

The troupe played in four different venues between 1680 and 1793, when the actors split into royalist and republican factions and the data in our database ends. The search and visualization tools we have created allow you to compare ticket sales and box office receipts in three fundamental categories across our entire time span: the parterre, or orchestra; the first loges; and total sales and attendance. But because the seating options in each venue differed substantially, it is not possible to compare all seating categories across the 113 seasons for which we possess tickets sales information.

We therefore offer you the option to study more detailed ticket sales and attendance patterns within the four periods that correspond to the troupe&rsquo;s occupancy of the four following venues:

* 1680-1689: Th&eacute;âtre Gu&eacute;n&eacute;gaud
* 1689-1770: [Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la rue des Fosses St-Germain](/en/the-data/theater-venues/salle-de-la-rue-des-fosses-saint-germain-des-pres)
* 1770-1782: [Salle des machines, Palais des thuil&eacute;ries](/en/the-data/theater-venues/salle-des-machines-palais-des-tuileries)
* 1782-1793: Th&eacute;âtre Od&eacute;on

For more detailed descriptions of each space, complemented by contemporary engravings of the playhouses, visit [link; also make each of the four theaters above link to the appropriate page that describes it]. For details about the editorial principles followed to create the database, see [link]. For information on the information technology underlying the database and the applications we have created to query it, see [link].

The troupe also kept detailed records of their daily expenditures, as well as cast lists for each performance. Registers recording information in these two categories, as well as a selection of more general administrative records, may also be accessed on our index register page [link]. These records are less complete than the daily receipts registers. At a future date, we hope to add expense and casting data to the box receipts database presented here.
