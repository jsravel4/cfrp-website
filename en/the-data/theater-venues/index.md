The troupe played in four different venues between 1680 and 1793, when the actors split into royalist and republican factions and the data in our database ends. The search and visualization tools we have created allow you to compare ticket sales and box office receipts in three fundamental categories across our entire time span: the parterre, or orchestra; the first loges; and total sales and attendance. But because the seating options in each venue differed substantially, it is not possible to compare all seating categories across the 113 seasons for which we possess tickets sales information.

We therefore offer you the option to study more detailed ticket sales and attendance patterns within the four periods that correspond to the troupe’s occupancy of the four following venues:

* 1680-1689: Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Gu&eacute;n&eacute;gaud
* 1689-1770: [Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la rue des Fosses St-Germain](/en/the-data/theater-venues/salle-de-la-rue-des-fosses-saint-germain-des-pres)
* 1770-1782: [Salle des machines, Palais des thuil&eacute;ries](/en/the-data/theater-venues/salle-des-machines-palais-des-tuileries)
* 1782-1793: Th&eacute;âtre Od&eacute;on
