The troupe played in four different venues between 1680 and 1793, when the actors split into royalist and republican factions and the data in our database ends. The map above displays the Parisian location of each venue. You may also learn more about each of these venues by following the links below:

The [faceted browser](/en/the-data/faceted-browser) allows you to compare ticket sales and box office receipts in three fundamental categories across our entire time span: the parterre, or orchestra; the first loges; and total nightly receipts. But because the seating options in each venue differed substantially, it is not possible to compare all seating categories across the entire 113 seasons in the database. In a future variant of the Cross-Tab browser, you will also be able to study more seating categories in individual venue periods in greater detail.
