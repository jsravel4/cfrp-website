Although Louis XIV officially founded the Com&eacute;die-Fran&ccedil;aise by lettre de cachet in 1680, the administrative origins of the troupe date to the death of Moli&egrave;re in 1673. When the great playwright/actor passed away in February 1673, the government merged his troupe with a group of actors who had been performing in the Marais district. This new theatrical entity acquired the lease on an indoor performance space on the Left Bank that had been built in 1671 to house an opera company. The theater, large enough to accommodate substantial audiences and various types of theatrical machinery, was initially known as the Jeu de paume de la bouteille, but later acquired the title H&ocirc;tel Gu&eacute;n&eacute;gaud, due to its location on the rue de Gu&eacute;n&eacute;guaud. Seven years after Moli&egrave;re’s death, the Sun King decided to merge the Gu&eacute;n&eacute;gaud troupe with the other remaining French-language troupe in the capital, then performing at the H&ocirc;tel de Bourgogne on the other side of the river. The new troupe, now the only public Paris option for spectators interested in the plays of Moli&egrave;re, Racine, Pierre Corneille, and other seventeenth-century French language playwrights, began nightly performances in the Gu&eacute;n&eacute;gaud theater on 25 August 1680. The Com&eacute;die-Fran&ccedil;aise Registers Project database, however, begins with the receipts from the first performnce of the Gu&eacute;n&eacute;gaud troupe in the 1680-1681 theatrical season, on 30 April 1680.

The H&ocirc;tel Gu&eacute;n&eacute;gaud is the least well-known of the four spaces in which the troupe played from 1680 to 1793. The only surviving contemporary image of the space, Figure 1, shows a view of the stage and four loges, arranged in two levels.

The pre-eminent modern student of this playhouse and the actors and performances it housed, Dr. Jan Clarke, has offered a schematic overview of the theater space as it may have appeared in the 1670s, before the creation of the Com&eacute;die-Fran&ccedil;aise (Figure 2). This rendering, which portrays the theater at the level of the first-row boxes, shows a ring of boxes surrounding a seated amphitheater at the top of the image, with the standing pit just below it. The stage is at the bottom.

The box office receipt registers from this period provide evidence that there were at least six different sectors of the playhouse, including seats on the stage itself, three levels of loges, the seated amphitheater, and the standing parterre. Figure 3, the register page from the first performance of the newly-created troupe, shows the pricing for these six ticket categories. The bottom half of the page, after the total receipt figure of 1424 pounds 5 shillings, is devoted to the troupe’s daily expenditures. This expense data has not yet been added to our database.

Beginning with the 1686-1687 season, the ticket category labels become more generic, making it difficult to reach definitive conclusions about the popularity and profitability of different seating areas. Figure 4, for example, the register page that records ticket sales for 11 February 1687, replaces specific names for categories with the generic &ldquo;billet&rdquo; (ticket) label, then adds handwritten qualifiers for two of the categories. Furthermore, the actor in charge of recording sales that day has added a fifth, handwritten category in between the first two &ldquo;billet&rdquo; categories which he has labeled &ldquo;deux loges.&rdquo; The troupe’s lack of specificity when recording ticket sales during the Gu&eacute;n&eacute;gaud years, when combined with our imperfect knowledge of the audience hall itself, makes it problematic to analyze revenue data at more granular levels.
