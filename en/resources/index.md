The Com&eacute;die-Fran&ccedil;aise Registers Project (CFRP) team seeks to build community around the material we have made available on line. We invite you to share your CFRP-based work with other scholars on our &ldquo;[Scholarship](scholarship)&rdquo; page, as well as your ideas for teaching with CFRP on our &ldquo;[Teaching Resources](teaching-resources)&rdquo; page. Our &ldquo;[Bibliography](bibliography)&rdquo; page lists selected work on the history of the Com&eacute;die-Fran&ccedil;aise in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
