title: Introduction to the Database
---

We offer two tools to access the database.

## [Faceted Browser](#link). This tool allows users introductory access to the database. Here you can explore data about authors, plays, genres, and selected ticket categories by season or by day of the week. By clicking on the camera icons on the left of the screen, you can also open up register pages in a new window.

## [Pivot Browser](#link). This tool allows users more advanced access to the database. Here you can build more sophisticated queries which will display in tabular format. The results in turn are linked to a calendrical visualisation.
